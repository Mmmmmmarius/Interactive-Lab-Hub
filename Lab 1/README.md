**THE MASTERWORK YOU DREW FROM THE HAT:** Clavilux, by Thomas Wilfred

**Source document:** [Lab 1a.pdf](Lab%201a.pdf)

---

One way to understand greatness is to look to the greats. Just as painters learn
the technique and artistry of the old masters by recreating their paintings, so
too shall we come to understand computer-mediated interaction by recreating the
interactive masterworks of our time.

This week, every team will draw a different masterwork from a hat. Some are
conceptual pieces, some are historical works, some are modern-day products —
but they all share one thing: **their central mode of interaction is carried by
light.** Think of Tinker Bell in the original stage production of *Peter Pan*,
represented by nothing more than a darting circle of light from an off-stage
mirror. There was no actor playing Tinker Bell; she existed entirely through the
way the other characters interacted with that light.

Your job is to recreate the *interaction* of the piece you drew — not to build a
museum-grade replica, but to stage the moment that makes it what it is. Someone
who knows your piece should watch your recreation and recognize it instantly.
Someone who has never heard of it should walk away understanding what it is
famous for.

You will do this using the interaction staging techniques we will use all semester: a
storyboard, some acting, a phone standing in as a controllable light (the
*Tinkerbelle* tool), a hidden human "wizard" driving it, a costume, and a
recorded video.

*Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole activity
before starting!*

## Prep

To start, you will need:

1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" by forking the [Interactive-Lab-Hub repository](https://github.com/IRL-CT/Interactive-Lab-Hub). To get lab updates, simply use [GitHub's "Sync fork" button](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) when new content is available.

3. Set up your `README.md` so it has your name and links to this lab. Learn to
   format a README [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
4. **Draw your masterwork from the hat and write it at the top of this file.**
   Whatever you drew is yours — lean into it.

## Materials

For this lab you will need:

1. Paper, markers/pens, scissors
2. A smartphone with a browser that can display a webpage (your stand-in "light")
3. A computer to host the control webpage
4. Found objects and materials to **costume your phone so it looks like the
   device in your masterwork** — doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, foil,
   a cardboard shell, whatever it takes. Be resourceful.

## Deliverables

Submit all of the following in this lab folder of your Lab Hub, as links or
uploaded files. **Each group member posts their own copy to their own Github repo**, even if the work is
shared.

1. A short **research write-up** of your masterwork (what it is, when, who made
   it, and — most importantly — what the interaction is)
2. **3 iterated storyboards** of the interaction in the masterwork
5. A **video sketch** of your prototyped interaction
6. Any **reflections** on the process

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked from your main class hub
page.

# The Report

## Part 0. Know Your Master

Before you prototype anything, get intimately acquainted with the piece you
drew. Do real research. You are looking less for trivia than for the *shape of
the interaction*:

- What inputs are available to the user? What responses does the work give?
- Who is present, and how does the piece color the relationships between them?
- What is the piece famous for? What are its strengths and its weaknesses?

  Sometimes the details of how the interaction worked are lost in history. Try filling it in with your imagination!

### Research: Clavilux

The Clavilux, invented by Thomas Wilfred in the early 20th century, is a performable instrument that generates *lumia*, a form of visual light art. It projects light onto a screen using glass discs, lenses, and motorized reflectors to create shifting shapes and colours. Its name comes from Latin and means "light played by key" (Wiki, as cited in the source PDF).

**What inputs are available to the user? What responses does the work give?**

The original model described in our research does not allow interaction between viewers and the installation: viewers can only watch predetermined patterns of lumia. Later versions allow interaction between the user and the device.

**Who is present, and how does the piece colour the relationships between them?**

The device and its viewers are present, generally an individual or a few people depending on the scale of the device. The relationship between the installation and the viewer depends on the possibility of interaction, since some models cannot be interacted with.

**What is the piece famous for? What are its strengths and its weaknesses?**

Clavilux offers an instrumental way of displaying lumia. The work and its inventor, Thomas Wilfred, demonstrate an avant-garde art form that influences people's understanding of what art can be and how it can be created.

## Part A. Plan

For your masterwork, reconstruct the interaction as a scene:

- **Setting:** Where and when does this interaction happen? (a jungle, a kitchen,
  a spaceship corridor, a nightclub, a harbor at night)
- **Players:** Who is involved? Who else is present? Think through everyone in
  the setting, not just the primary user.
- **Activity:** What is happening between the players and the light?
- **Goals:** What is each player trying to do?

### Design concept

In these performances, light was the medium of expression. This led us to consider how light can communicate intention and affect emotions. Our proposed device explores this idea through an interactive process that reads the user's facial expressions and physical actions to generate different themes of shapes and colours, with the aim of influencing their mood. The device also changes colour based on the weather and time, providing users with a clear visual interpretation of their surroundings.

In our design, light serves two main purposes: it creates a congenial atmosphere to influence emotion, and it acts as an effective medium of communication.

- **Setting:** The interaction takes place inside an individual's living space, in an area intended for relaxation and mindfulness.
- **Players:** The main players are the occupant and the lighting device. Friends and family may occasionally visit, but the general interaction process remains the same. When multiple faces are recognised, the proposed device changes its behaviour based on an algorithm that identifies scenarios such as a party, family dining, or a late-night conversation.
- **Activity:** The device would automatically collect, analyse, and react to inputs including facial expressions, body posture, sound, season, and other relevant memories. It would generate corresponding lumia to support mindfulness, altering illumination, pace, and colour while providing a clear visual interpretation of the surroundings.
- **Goals:** The device aims to create a congenial atmosphere that gives the occupant a sense of belonging and comfort. It also serves as a medium of communication, helping users understand their surroundings through light.

Now **sketch a 3 storyboards** of the interaction you are recreating. (The number may depend on the thing you drew, but stretch your thinking!) They
don't need to be beautiful, but they must capture and communicate not only the behavior of the light, but how it affects
and the people around it. If you're new to storyboarding, read
[this explanation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/storyboards-visualize-ideas/).

### Storyboards

#### 1. Responding to environmental input

![Three storyboard panels showing lights off, lights matching television colours, and lighting responding to different television content.](images/lab-1a-environmental-input.png)

1. Surrounding lights are off when there is no environmental input.
2. The lights may react to environmental input, such as the colour theme of the television content.
3. The lighting device may also respond to the type of television content, such as music, a podcast, or wallpaper, and act accordingly.

#### 2. Responding to body gestures

![Three storyboard panels showing a bedside light switched on, switched off when the occupant sleeps, and providing light when the occupant gets up at night.](images/lab-1a-body-gestures.png)

1. Lighting devices can be turned on or off at any time with a physical switch.
2. They may also react automatically to body gesture recognition. For example, when the device notices someone trying to sleep, it may turn off.
3. The response may change with context. If someone gets up in the middle of the night, the device may provide appropriate illumination for their purpose, such as going to the restroom.

#### 3. Responding to behaviour

![Three storyboard panels showing a person entering a room, sitting down to read, and receiving coordinated ambient and reading light.](images/lab-1a-behaviour.png)

1. Lighting devices may serve different purposes according to the participant's intentions and behaviour. They can provide general illumination while someone navigates the space.
2. If the person starts another activity, such as reading, the system may recognise that behaviour and communicate it to the lighting devices.
3. The devices may then coordinate adjustments to colour and brightness to better fulfil the needs of the activity.

#### 4. Responding to weather

![Four storyboard panels showing a cloudy morning, a user waking up, a device displaying shapes and colours based on the weather and time, and the user interpreting the light as slightly cloudy weather.](images/lab-1a-weather.png)

1. It is a cloudy morning.
2. The user wakes up and wonders what the weather is like.
3. The device detects that the user is awake and displays different shapes and colours based on the weather and time.
4. The user sees the lighting and understands that it is slightly cloudy.

Use the storyboards to decide what interaction to prototype.

**Summarize the feedback you got here.**

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Physically act out the interaction you planned. For now, just pretend the light
is doing what you've scripted — a person can wave a flashlight, or you can narrate
it aloud.

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than when acted out?**

**Did new ideas about the piece surface once you were on your feet?**

**Are there key moments in the interaction where things could go in a different direction?**
Iterate your storyboards to capture key non-sequential aspects of the interaction. 

## Part C. Prototype the Light (light first!)

Use your smartphone as the light of your device. Open the browser on your phone
to act as the "light," and use the remote control interface on your computer to
change that light. Code and setup instructions for the *Tinkerbelle* tool are
[here](https://github.com/IRL-CT/tinkerbelle) (we invented this tool for
this lab). If you hit technical trouble, a manually or remotely controlled light
switch, dimmer, or lamp is a fine substitute.

**Get the light interaction working before anything else.** Your grade this week
rides on the *light* being recognizable — the color, the rhythm, the timing, the
way it answers a person. Only once your light interaction genuinely reads as your
masterwork should you consider layering in a second modality (sound, vibration,
motion). If in doubt, keep polishing the light. The other modalities are next
week's business.

## Part D. Wizard the Device

Set up a "wizard" arrangement so one person can secretly drive the light while
another acts with it — this is how you make the device feel alive without
building any real electronics. (Zoom works well for recording; you can pin the
video feed of whichever scene you want to capture.)

**Include your first attempts at recording the wizarded set-up here.**

[Wizard_the_device.mp4](Wizard_the_device.mp4)

## Part E. (optional) Costume the Device

Only now should you worry about what the device looks like. Costume your phone so it reads
as the object from your masterwork — HAL's eye, a Simon shell, a paper-lantern
Tinker Bell, an Ambient Orb, a lighthouse, a jack-o'-lantern, whatever you drew.

Think about the world your device lives in: could that environment overheat it?
Is water a danger? Does it need to be loud and bright for an emergency, or quiet
and calm for a bedroom?

**Include sketches/photos of what your device might look like here.**

**What concerns or opportunities shaped the way you designed its look?**

## Part F. Record

**Record your prototyped interaction as a video sketch.** Aim for the bar from
the top of this lab: a viewer who knows the piece should recognize it; a viewer
who doesn't should come away understanding what it's famous for. How might you illustrate the non-sequential aspects of the interaction in the sketch?

**Include your video here.**

**Please indicate who you collaborated with on this lab.** Be generous in
acknowledging their contributions, and credit any other influences (YouTube,
Github, Twitter, a friend who lent you a lamp) that informed your recreation.

# Part 2 — ReMastering the light

*This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.*

## Prep (before the next lab)

Find three other groups. (How? Maybe Slack?) Visit their Lab Hub pages, watch their
videos, and give them reactions and feedback: tell them what you saw happening,
guess the masterwork and the goals of the characters, and ask about anything that
wasn't clear.

**Who were the other groups you kibitzed with? Add links to their project pages here.**
**Summarize the feedback you got from your partners here.**

## Remix, Update, or Critique the Master

Now that you understand your masterwork from the inside, respond to it. Do the
recreation again, but this time make it your own — pick one of these moves (or
combine them):

1. **Remix the modality.** Your recreation no longer has to (just) use light. Use
   vibration, sound, motion, heat — whatever best carries the interaction. Feel
   free to fork and modify the Tinkerbelle code. (Add your updates to this lab's folder!)
2. **Update it.** Redesign the piece for today's context, or for a setting its
   creators never imagined (the piece with roommates in the room, with children
   present, on a phone, in a car).
3. **Fix its weaknesses.** You identified this master's strengths and weaknesses
   in Part 0 — now address a weakness, or push a strength further.

We will grade this second pass with an emphasis on **creativity** and on how well
your response engages with what your master was really doing.

**Document everything here — especially the storyboard and video. Photos of the
prototype are great too.**
